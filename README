Eagle_Files folder:
Schemas for building your own Bluetooth module adaptor pcb.
PCB is one layer only, so it's easy to realize also with the toner transfer tecnique

There are few variant:

- v01
complete module breakout;
all module pins available on the header.

- v02
module adaptor with built-in voltage divider for RX & AT pin, plus STATUS and PAIRING leds; 
5 pins available on the header: 3.3V, GND, AT, RX, TX.

- v03
module adaptor with built-in resistors (no voltage divider) for RX & AT pin, plus STATUS and PAIRING leds;
