Bluetooth BC4 (HC05, HC06, HC0*) module adaptor to use with MCU (Arduino & co)

For more info about bluetooth module use, download the guides attached here:

Eagle_Files folder:
Schemas for building your own Bluetooth module adaptor pcb.
PCB is one layer only, so it's easy to realize also with the toner transfer tecnique

There are few variant:

- v01 (.sch only)
complete module breakout;
all module pins available on the header.

- v02 (.sch only)
module adaptor with built-in voltage divider for RX & AT pin, plus STATUS and PAIRING leds; 
5 pins available on the header: 3.3V, GND, AT, RX, TX.

- v03  (.sch only) & v05 (.sch + .brd)
module adaptor with built-in resistors (no voltage divider) for RX & AT pin, plus STATUS and PAIRING leds;
5 pins available on the header: 3.3V, GND, AT, RX, TX.

- v06 (.sch + .brd)
module adaptor with built-in resistors (no voltage divider) for RX & AT pin, plus STATUS and PAIRING leds;
added a jumper for the AT programming;
added also a solder jumper for the pairing led pin: in HC05 the pin is PIO8, in HC06 the pin is PIO1;  
4 pins available on the header: 3.3V, GND, RX, TX.
